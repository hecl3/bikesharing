**Overview of the analysis:**

For this analysis we specifically looked at the NYC Citibikes program and how it might translate to a similar program in Des Moines, IA.

**Results:**

Here is a link to the story in Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/helena.claybrook/viz/Challenge14_16495432251560/NYCCitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes

Here is a simple pie chart showing the divide between one time "Customers" and "Subscribers", people who pay a monthly fee for the service. Subscribers make up the vast majority of users, at almost 2 million, in contrast to about 443K customers.

Next we have the breakdown of users by gender. "O" means Unknown, "1" is Male, and "2" is Female. Men make up the majority of users at 1,530,272, compared to just over 590K for women.

Here we have the average trip duration. Most users take rides no longer than 5 minutes.

Here is the Trip Duration graph broken down further by gender. Men's rides still peak at about 5 minutes on average, women ride slightly longer at 6 minutes. Those who didn't share their gender seem to have also ridden the longest, peaking at about 10 minutes.

This heat map shows the busiest days and times for all users. Thursday is the busiest day, with heavy traffic on Mondays and Tuesdays as well. Peak times are at 5-6 PM, though there is some heavy traffic at around 8 AM as well. Weekends look fairly steady, though not as busy.

The above 3 images are the gendered breakdown of busiest weekdays. Each of them remain fairly consistent with Mondays, Tuesdays, and especially Thursdays being the busiest days, particularly at 5-6 PM in the evenings. Women also have a slight busy period at 8 AM on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and men from 6-9 AM. Men tend to ride a fair amount on the weekends, though not as much as the Unknown category. Saturday seems to be an especially popular day for the Unknown category.

Last is a breakdown of user trips by user type and gender. As we can see, the heaviest users, of any gender category, are the Subscribers. Customers of any gender seem to use this service mostly on weekends, particularly Saturday. Subscribers of any gender seem to use this service mostly on weekdays, especially Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Wednesday seems to be the lightest day of all categories. Male Subscribers tend to use this service a lot on Friday's as well. 

**Summary:**

Per all the results we can infer a couple things. The Customers, being casual users, tend to use this service mostly on weekends. Subscribers on the other hand tend to use this as a way of commuting. Men make up the vast majority of users, and most of the client base is subscribers. I would suggest doing another visualization based off trip duration by user type, to see how long subscribers ride vs customers. I would also do a visualization for top starting and ending locations for both Customers and Subscribers.
